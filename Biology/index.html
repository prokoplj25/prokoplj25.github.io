  <h1> Huntington's disease </h1>
 
  <h3>Definition of HUngingtons disease:</h3>
  <p> A genetic disorder that causes your nerves to progressively breakdown.</p>
 
  <h3> What happens to the body? </h3>
 <p>The nerves in the body begin to break down which causes sporadic movement, decline in thinking and reasoning skills, organization, mood swings, ect. Eventually this will lead to death or a state of unconsciousness>p>
  
   
  <h3>What part of the body does it generally affect?</h3>
   <p> Brain and nervous system</p>

  <h2> All possible effects on the body </h2>
  <p> Involuntary jerking or writhing movements (chorea)Muscle problems, such as rigidity or muscle contracture (dystonia)Slow or abnormal eye movements.Impaired gait, posture and balance.Difficulty with speech or swallowing.difficulty concentrating.memory lapses.depression – including low mood, a lack of interest in things,, and feelings of hopelessness.stumbling and clumsiness.mood swings, such as irritability or aggressive behavior.</p>
  
  <h1>Cause of disorder</h1>
  
  <h3> What happens in the body to cause the disease? </h3>
   <p>  A mutation on the 4th chromosome which is dominant and codes for the huntington's protein. </p>
  
  <h2>  How is it inherited? </h2>
  
  <h3> Is it sex-linked?What type of genetic inheritance is it? </h3>
  <p>Caused by a single deficient gene on the 4th chromosome. The defect is dominant. Codes for the Huntington's protein.</p>
  
  <h2>How is the disorder treated and how is it diagnosed? </h2>
  <p> Physical therapy helps improve quality of life through prescribed exercise, hands-on care, and patient education.  Xenazine helps with reducing sporadic and involuntary movements, Austedo helps reduce the implications that are from Huntington's disease.</p>
  
  <h3> What tests are done? Is genetic counseling an option?</h2]3>
   <p>Genetics testing and Yes</p>
  
  <h3> How common it is? </h3>
  <p> Fewer than 200,000 US cases per year< </p>
   
   <h3> Is it more common in a certain group of people? </h3>
  <p> Yes, 3 to 7 people per 100,000 people have it with a European ancestry.</p>

  <h2> What I learned </h2>
  
  <p> That Huntington's disease is caused by the 4th Chromosome and that it’s a dominant trait. I also learned that it’s actually more common for people with European ancestry to have it.</p>
